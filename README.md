# myfirstBI #

These are my first panels with Microsoft Power BI. Results of training conducted at the Data Science Academy, in Brazil,
taught by master Daniel Mendes (great teacher)! Own creations developed from databases provided in the course.
I recommend the course for Brazilians or Portuguese speakers.
The school is a reference when it comes to data science!
Good studies =]
